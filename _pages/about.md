I am a PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto 
and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 
My academic advisors are [Prof. Daniel Roy](http://danroy.org/) 
and [Prof. Murat Erdogdu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/). 

Previously I was a Masters student in the same department, during which I worked with [Prof. Jeffrey Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). For my undergraduate degree I studied [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My undergraduate thesis was supervised by [Prof. Christina Christara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ccc/). You can find my CV [here](files/CV_Mufan_Li.pdf).

# Research

I am generally interested in studying theoretical properties 
of learning algorithms, 
in particular using tools of probability theory, 
stochastic analysis, and partial differential equations. 

You can find a list of my research [here](https://mufan-li.github.io/research/).

# Blog

I attempt to maintain a blog of interesting mathematics I encouter, 
but does not necessarily fit into my research program. 
You can find the current list of my blog posts 
[here](https://mufan-li.github.io/blog-posts/).
