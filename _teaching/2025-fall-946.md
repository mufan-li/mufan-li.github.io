# Description

This topics course intends to explore **scaling limits** of neural networks. In particular, we will study the limits as the number of parameters in a neural network approaches infinity in different regimes, where the limiting object is intended to be used as a model for finite size neural networks in practice. Beyond convergence, we will also study the properties and the theoretical properties of the limiting objects, and their implications on practice.

<!-- Topics potentially covered in this course include: Neural network Gaussian processes, neural tangent kernel, limiting spectrum, double descent, mean-field neural network PDE, feature learning, dynamical mean field theory, single index models, neural ODE, infinite-depth ResNets, neural covariance SDE, and other extensions. -->

Background in probability, differential equations, and stochastic analysis are desirable but not required.
