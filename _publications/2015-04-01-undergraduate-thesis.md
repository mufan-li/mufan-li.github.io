<!-- The main difficulty in pricing American options comes from the early exercise right, creating a non-linear constraint on the Black-Scholes PDE. Under a finite difference discretization of the PDE, the price of an American can be approximated, with several techniques to properly handle the American Constraint. While both an iterative penalty method and a direct operator splitting method are convergent, the efficiency and quality require a comprehensive study. Using Crank-Nicolson time stepping and non-uniform grids, the methods are compared in numerical experiments. The criteria include order of convergence, efficiency, and complexity. -->
